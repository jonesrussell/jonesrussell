# **Russell Jones**
**Backend developer, game dev learner, and infrastructure tinkerer.**

I build systems that make developers faster — and break things in game engines so I can learn how they work.

## 🚀 What I’m Building
- **North Cloud** — real‑time content intelligence with crawling, enrichment, and streaming pipelines.  
- **Gimbal** — a Gyruss‑style orbital shooter in Go (Ebitengine).  
- **GoFormX** — a fast, modular form builder + backend.  
- **MP Emailer** — a civic tool for contacting MPs.

## 🛠️ My Toolbox
**Go • PHP • Laravel • Docker • Linux**  
ECS patterns, crawling pipelines, DX‑focused tooling.

## 🎯 What I Care About
- Clean, modernized legacy systems  
- Developer experience  
- Creative tech + game dev  
- Infrastructure that doesn’t fight you
